These first eight years\nof conflict also included naval incidents and cyberwarfare. In February 2022, Russia launched\na full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the country, starting the biggest\nconflict in Europe since World War II.\nIn early 2014, the Euromaidan protests led to the Revolution of Dignity and the ousting of\nUkraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Shortly after, pro-Russian unrest erupted\nin eastern and southern Ukraine, while unmarked Russian troops occupied Crimea. Russia\nsoon annexed Crimea after a highly disputed referendum. In April 2014, Russian-backed\nmilitants seized towns in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and proclaimed the Donetsk\nPeople's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states,\nstarting the Donbas war. Russia covertly supported the separatists with its own troops, tanks\nand artillery, and Ukraine failed to fully retake the territory. In February 2015, Russia and\nUkraine signed the Minsk II agreements to end the conflict, but they were never fully\nimplemented in the years that followed. The Donbas war settled into a violent but static\nconflict between Ukraine and the Russian and separatist forces, with many brief ceasefires but\nno lasting peace and few changes in territorial control.\nBeginning in 2021, there was a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine's borders,\nincluding within neighbouring Belarus. Russian officials repeatedly denied plans to attack\nUkraine. Russia's president Vladimir Putin expressed irredentist views and denied Ukraine's\nright to exist. He demanded that Ukraine be barred from ever joining the NATO military\nalliance. In early 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.\n8/15/24, 8:24 PM\nRusso-Ukrainian War - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War#:~:text=The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War,included naval incidents and cyberwarfare.\n1/74\n \n\nText:  June–August 2014 progression map\nResidents of Kyiv with Sich Battalion\nvolunteers on 26 August 2014\nThe Pskov-based 76th Guards Air Assault Division allegedly entered Ukrainian territory in August and\nengaged in a skirmish near Luhansk, suffering 80 dead. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that they had\nseized two of the unit's armoured vehicles near Luhansk, and reported destroying another three tanks and two\narmoured vehicles in other regions.[135]\nThe speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament and Russian state television channels acknowledged that\nRussian soldiers entered Ukraine, but referred to them as \"volunteers\".[136] A reporter for Novaya Gazeta, an\nopposition newspaper in Russia, stated that the Russian military leadership paid soldiers to resign their\ncommissions and fight in Ukraine in the early summer of 2014, and then began ordering soldiers into\nUkraine.[137] Russian opposition MP Lev Shlosberg made similar statements, although he said combatants\nfrom his country are \"regular Russian troops\", disguised as units of the DPR and LPR.[138]\nIn early September 2014, Russian state-owned television channels reported on the funerals of Russian soldiers\nwho had died in Ukraine, but described them as \"volunteers\" fighting for the \"Russian world\". Valentina\nMatviyenko, a top United Russia politician, also praised \"volunteers\" fighting in \"our fraternal nation\".[136]\nRussian state television for the first time showed the funeral of a soldier killed fighting in Ukraine.[139]\nOn 3 September, Poroshenko said he and Putin had reached a \"permanent ceasefire\" agreement.[140] Russia\ndenied this, denying that it was a party to the conflict, adding that \"they only discussed how to settle the\nconflict\".[141][142] Poroshenko then recanted.[143][144] On 5 September Russia's Permanent OSCE\nRepresentative Andrey Kelin, said that it was natural that pro-Russian separatists \"are going to liberate\"\nMariupol. Ukrainian forces stated that Russian intelligence groups had been spotted in the area. Kelin said\n'there might be volunteers over there.'[145] On 4 September 2014, a NATO officer said that several thousand\nregular Russian forces were operating in Ukraine.[146]\nOn 5 September 2014, the Minsk Protocol ceasefire agreement drew a line of demarcation between Ukraine\nand separatist-controlled portions of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts.\nMariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\nEnd of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n8/15/24, 8:24 PM\nRusso-Ukrainian War - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War#:~:text=The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War,included naval incidents and cyberwarfare.\n9/74\n \n\nText:  Russian-backed separatists in May\n2016\nThe Kerch Strait incident over the\npassage between the Black and\nAzov seas\nRussia gained de facto control of the Kerch Strait in 2014. In 2017, Ukraine appealed to a court of arbitration\nover the use of the strait. By 2018 Russia had built a bridge over the strait, limiting the size of ships that could\npass through, imposed new regulations, and repeatedly detained Ukrainian vessels.[181] On 25 November\n2018, three Ukrainian boats traveling from Odesa to Mariupol were seized by Russian warships; 24 Ukrainian\nsailors were detained.[182][183] A day later on 26 November 2018, the Ukrainian parliament overwhelmingly\nbacked the imposition of martial law along Ukraine's coastal regions and those bordering Russia.[184]\nMore than 110 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the conflict in 2019.[185] In May 2019, newly elected\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took office promising to end the war in Donbas.[185] In December\n2019, Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists began swapping prisoners of war. Around 200 prisoners were\nexchanged on 29 December 2019.[186][187][188][189] According to Ukrainian authorities, 50 Ukrainian soldiers\nwere killed in 2020.[190] Between 2019 and 2021, Russia issued over 650,000 internal Russian passports to\nUkrainians.[191][192]\nThere were 27 conflict-related civilian deaths in 2019, 26 deaths in 2020, and 25 deaths in 2021, over half of\nthem from mines and unexploded ordnance.[193]\nFrom March to April 2021, Russia commenced a major military build-up near the border, followed by a\nsecond build-up between October 2021 to February 2022 in Russia and Belarus.[194] Throughout, the Russian\ngovernment repeatedly denied it had plans to attack Ukraine.[195][196]\nIn early December 2021, following Russian denials, the US released intelligence of Russian invasion plans, including satellite photographs\nshowing Russian troops and equipment near the border.[197] The intelligence reported a Russian list of key sites and individuals to be killed or\nneutralized.[198] The US released multiple reports that accurately predicted the invasion plans.[198]\nIn the months preceding the invasion, Russian officials accused Ukraine of inciting tensions, Russophobia, and repressing Russian speakers. They\nmade multiple security demands of Ukraine, NATO, and other EU countries. On 9 December 2021 Putin said that \"Russophobia is a first step\ntowards genocide\".[199][200] Putin's claims were dismissed by the international community,[201] and Russian claims of genocide were rejected as\n2019–2020\nRussian military buildup around Ukraine (2021–2022)\nRussian accusations and demands\n8/15/24, 8:24 PM\nRusso-Ukrainian War - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War#:~:text=The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War,included naval incidents and cyberwarfare.\n12/74\n \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# docs2 = vectordb2.similarity_search(query2)\n# print(f\"Query: {query2}\")\n# print(f\"Retrieved documents: {len(bidendocs)}\")\n# for doc in docs:\n#     doc_details = doc.to_json()['kwargs']\n# #     print(\"Source: \", doc_details['metadata']['source'])\n#     print(\"Text: \", doc_details['page_content'], \"\\n\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-15T14:05:16.310777Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-15T14:05:16.311137Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-15T14:05:16.310947Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-15T14:05:16.310962Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# docs3 = vectordb3.similarity_search(query3)\n# print(f\"Query: {query3}\")\n# print(f\"Retrieved documents: {len(jonbenetdocs)}\")\n# for doc in docs:\n#     doc_details = doc.to_json()['kwargs']\n# #     print(\"Source: \", doc_details['metadata']['source'])\n#     print(\"Text: \", doc_details['page_content'], \"\\n\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-15T14:05:16.312743Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-15T14:05:16.313129Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-15T14:05:16.312931Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-15T14:05:16.312946Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
